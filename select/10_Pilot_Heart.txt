Doesn't it look good for flying?
Can't wait for high noon to fall into night
I put out my arms and the air just takes me
Rising moon calls me into the sky
Up, up I go searching on my radio

Pilot through time
Spirit flying
Move with mine
Out of time

Pilot I fell through
From the blue
I just flew
Into you

If the air is high and I hear the moon
I'll find you alright
Wherever you're hiding in the night
I know it won't be long
Your signal is getting strong

Pilot through time
Spirit flying
Move with mine
Out of time

Pilot I fell through
From the blue
I just flew
Into you

Spirit flying
Move with mine
Out of time

From the blue
I feel blue
I just flew
