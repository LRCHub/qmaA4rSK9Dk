Sometimes I feel out of control
2, 000 miles away you take a shower
To keep the fur at bay,
I shave on the hour
3 says I'll see you 4 says I won't
5 days I'll go up tonight

The sun casts black shadows on the Pan-Am roof
And an airport detective rolls over
Sometimes I forget what some of the dials do
Maybe I'll go up tonight
Sometimes I feel out of control
Look at the monkey in the sky
See him dip, see him swing
Look out the monkey in the sky
Look at the tears in his eyes
I put the square peg in the square hole
And the round one in my mouth
I'd take a spin but I don't bet
Maybe I'll go up tonight
Sometimes I feel I like a monkey pilot
Sometimes I feel out of control
