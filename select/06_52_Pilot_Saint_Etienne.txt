You're the pilot, you're the pilot
You're the pilot

You're the pilot, you're the pilot
You're the pilot

To my left the course of a stream
From it's source in the hills
Winding down to a port by the sea
And on my right there's a girl on the wing
"Take control, you're the pilot
You're the pilot, take control... take control"
