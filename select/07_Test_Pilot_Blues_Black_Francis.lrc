[00:09.63] Breathing mask, gloves, and leather
[00:24.23] Stations of the cross
[00:27.78] I got no wings full of feathers
[00:31.96] Just my engines and a little sauce
[00:48.96] 
[00:35.02] I ne'er go up just for the money
[00:38.97] I ne'er go halfway
[00:42.32] You know I always wanna do you honey
[00:46.16] But I don't wanna fade away
[00:59.66] 
[00:49.30] It ain't no use
[00:54.97] Test pilot blues
[00:59.23] A sunny day
[01:03.46] Boy it sure do hurt
[01:07.66] Big bang sky
[01:10.81] A big bang dirt
[01:18.31] 
[01:16.19] I've seen blue you've never seen
[01:20.83] And I've seen you from on high
[01:24.92] I've been places you never have been
[01:28.27] I wait for you to not reply
[01:41.77] 
[01:32.12] It ain't no use
[01:36.03] These test pilot blues
[01:41.24] Here it comes
[01:45.23] I love this part
[01:51.49] Yeah, we did it
[01:58.99] 
[01:53.89] I ne'er go up just for the money
[01:57.19] I'd ne'er go halfway
[02:00.86] You know I always wanna do you honey
[02:04.86] But I don't wanna fade away
[02:18.36] 
[02:09.53] It ain't no use
[02:13.65] These test pilot blues
[02:17.95] A cloudy day, boy it sure do hurt
[02:25.83] Big bang sky, big bang dirt
[02:32.47] Big bang sky, big bang dirt
[02:38.18] Big bang sky, big bang dirt
