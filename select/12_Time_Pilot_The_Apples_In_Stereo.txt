Whether you are lying down or seated in a chair, adjust yourself to your most comfortable position. Close your eyes and allow yourself to relax as deeply as you possibly can. With every second that goes by, you will find it easier to concentrate on my voice, and you will be able to hear me no matter what other sounds may occur.

Time is just what they say
Everything's changing
And then it slips away

Life on the promenade
Everyone's gesturing
But they got nothing to say
Styles
They come back around
Everyone's wondering
Just when you'll come back down

Frayed yet light souvenirs (?)
Everything's flickering
And ringing in your ears.

Phys, you will be settled and relaxed. Men, you will have strength of char and tranquility. You will use this record often and year time you hear my voice you will become more physically and mentally relaxed than before. This relaxed condition will remain with you, developing more strongly each time you play this record. Now, slowly, you may open your eyes, feeling wonderful. And... awaken.
